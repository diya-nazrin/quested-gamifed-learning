# QuestEd – Gamified Learning Platform 

QuestEd is a gamified learning platform that enables users to learn new skills by transforming the learning process into an interactive quest-based experience. Each skill is structured as a series of quests, challenges, and milestones, motivating learners through experience points (XP), levels, streaks, and achievements.
